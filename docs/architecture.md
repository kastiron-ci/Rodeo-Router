# Architectural Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the project. It is intended to provide a high-level understanding of the system and its components.

## Components

![Rodeo Router Components](../images/rodeo-components.png)

The Rodeo Router project is composed of several key components:

- `rodeoctl`: The primary CLI tool for managing the Rodeo Router
- `rodeod`: The system init daemon that runs on the router
- `apid`: The API daemon that provides GRPC and RESTful API for managing the router
- `routerd`: The core routing daemon that manages many third-party services such as FRR, Kea, and Bind
- `trustd`: The trust daemon that manages the trust relationships between the router, subcomponents, and high-availability peers
- `loggerd`: The logging daemon that manages the logs generated by the router
- `udevd`: The device management daemon that manages devices connected to the router
- `consoled`: The console daemon that provides a console interface for managing the router

### Potential Components (TBD)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These components have not been fully defined and may not be included in the final architecture.

- `configd`: The configuration daemon that manages the configuration of the router
