# About Rodeo

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of the Rodeo Router project. It is intended to give a brief introduction to the project, the goals, and the foundation of what we are building.

## What is Rodeo?

Rodeo is a modern Router OS being built to fill the gaps where existing solutions fall short. Taking after projects like [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) with a security-first approach, Rodeo is being designed with programatic configuration management, immutability, and security off the bat.

## Goals

The primary goals of Rodeo are simple:

- **Security**: Designed to be secure by default with a minimal attack surface and a focus on immutability
- **Performance**: Built with performance in mind, Rodeo is designed to be fast and efficient
- **Programmability**: Rodeo is designed to be managed programmatically, with a focus on automation and configuration management

## Foundation

Rodeo is built on a few key technologies:

- **[Go](https://golang.org/)**: The core of Rodeo and its components are written in Go
- **[ISC Kea](https://www.isc.org/kea/)**: ISC's modern DHCP server
- **[ISC Bind](https://www.isc.org/bind/)**: ISC's modern DNS server
